# Model Evaluation Metrics Explanation:

# Evaluation metrics are used to measure the
# performance of a machine learning model.

# Common metrics:
# - Accuracy
# - Precision
# - Recall
# - F1 Score

# These metrics help understand how well the model
# is making predictions and where it is making mistakes.

# Used in:
# - Model comparison
# - Performance analysis
# - Real-world ML deployment
